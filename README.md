Ever since moving to the Bay Area, DoorDash has found a loyal customer in me. It's always fun reverse-engineering REST APIs, and understanding how DoorDash interacts with the Internet. Door Dash encrypts its network traffic using SSL, but this is really easy to get around using a simple Man-in-the-middle attack.

# Design

Have been meaning to learn Python since quite some time, this gives me an opportunity to do that. Since this is a Python library, this is meant to be used in CLI environments. The API is really really rough around the edges, though I have tried to handle failing conditions gracefully.

# Pre-requisites

You'll need an DoorDash account with payment information added.

# Using

1. Authenticate to DoorDash using your credentials
2. From the list of restaurants, select one (you can sort based on the rating, price, and the availability)
3. The restaurant's beer menu will be displayed.
4. Select the beer you'll like to order, the quantity, and mention any special instructions if you have any
5. Confirm order, select the amount you'll to tip. Your default payment option will be used.
6. You're set

# Future

Well, how about ordering DoorDash from your Macbook's menu-bar? Or creating a insta-bobba tea functionality?
